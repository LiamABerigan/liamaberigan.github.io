Website under construction! Your patience is appreciated.

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the [University of Maine](https://www.umaine.edu) in the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Conservation Biology. My work focuses on the movements, habitat use, and population dynamics of wildlife, especially bird species. I have particular interests in migration and the conservation of at-risk species through techniques such as translocation.

I am also passionate about the effective communication of results and scientific recommendations to wildlife agencies and the public. Some of my recent work has used [Shiny](https://www.shinyapps.io/) applications as an interactive platform to allow stakeholders to access data and results. I've included a gallery of those applications [here](applications.html).

My CV is available [here](files/Liam_Berigan_CV_12_4_2022.pdf).
