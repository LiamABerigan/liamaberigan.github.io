Starting in spring 2022, I began using an external shotgun microphone attached to my cell phone to record bird calls. While it doesn't quite stand up to the quality of recordings from a [parabolic microphone and digital audio recorder](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/resources/audio-recording-gear), it provides a low cost and portable option which works well for documenting unusual birds and behaviors. A full set of my recordings are available on [eBird](https://media.ebird.org/catalog?userId=USER452492&mediaType=audio&sort=obs_date_desc), although I've included some highlights below.
