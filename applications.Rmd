During my work with the Eastern Woodcock Migration Research Cooperative ([EWMRC](https://www.woodcockmigration.org/)) I built several tools to improve our ability to communicate results to the public. The first is the [Migration Exploration App](https://www.woodcockmigration.org/migration.html), which is used in concert with our weekly updates to update the public on the migratory routes and timing of tagged woodcock. The second application is the [Archived Data Exploration App](https://www.woodcockmigration.org/explore-data.html), which allows users to view full migrations from over 500 tagged woodcock throughout the course of the project.

During a collaborative project with the [Pennsylvania Game Commission](www.google.com), we built an application to allow PGC employees to interactively weight migratory and breeding season habitat suitability when making woodcock habitat conservation decisions. The resulting application, called [W-PAST](https://woodcock.shinyapps.io/W-PAST), has since been used to support woodcock habitat funding proposals in Pennsylvania.
