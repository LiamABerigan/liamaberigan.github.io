## Teaching at Auburn

I specialize in teaching quantitative methods and statistics from an ecological perspective, including topics such as regression, population dynamics, and Bayesian statistics. I expect to begin teaching an undergraduate course in natural resources statistics (WILD 5750) in Spring 2026, with additional courses to follow.
